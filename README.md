# predict.me - a CMSC190 special project

```
predict.me is a Google Chrome extension that allows users to utilize the power of text predictor systems widely available in phones in the comfort of their own browser.

This application utilizes a trie for the letter-level prediction network and a probability matrix in the word-level prediction network. For technologies used, this application uses base HTML, CSS and Javascript along with the Chrome API to integrate the application into the browser.

This project is made as part of the requirements of CMSC190, an undergraduate subject offered in the BS Computer Science curriculum.
As part of the methodology, this repository shall serve as the storage for the progress done throughout the development of the application, including the other various requirements of the CMSC190 subject.
